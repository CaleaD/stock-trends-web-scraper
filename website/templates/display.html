            Shares of Longeveron Inc. blasted 120.9% higher on very active
            morning trading Thursday, after the biotechnology company said its
            Lomecel-B for the treatment of a congenital heart defect in infants
            (Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome) affecting about 1,000 babies a
            year was granted rare pediatric disease (RPD) designation by the
            Food and Drug Administration. Trading volume exploded to 112.0
            million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 110,000
            shares. The stock was both the biggest gainer and most active on
            major U.S. exchanges. The company said Lomecel-B is currently being
            evaluated in a Phase 2 trial. Despite the rally, the…

            The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday that
            domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 26 billion cubic feet for
            the week ended Nov. 12. IHS Markit had forecast an increase of 24
            billion cubic feet. Total stocks now stand at 3.644 trillion cubic
            feet, down 310 billion cubic feet from a year ago and 81 billion
            cubic feet below the five-year average, the government said.
            Following the data, December natural gas traded up by 13.4 cents, or
            2.8%, at $4.95 per million British thermal units. Prices were at
            $4.961 shortly before the data. Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire…

            Shares of Cisco Systems Inc. tumbled 9.0% in toward a six-month low
            in morning trading Thursday, to pace both the Dow Jones Industrial
            Average's and S&P 500's decliners, in the wake of the networking
            company's disappointing fiscal first-quarter report. The stock is
            headed for the biggest one-day percentage selloff since it plunged
            11.2% on Aug. 13, 2020, which followed Cisco's fiscal fourth-quarter
            2020 results. The stock's price decline of $5.09 was shaving about
            34 points off the Dow's price, which is down 188 points, or 0.5%. If
            there is a silver lining to Cisco's stock drop, it's that Cisco's
